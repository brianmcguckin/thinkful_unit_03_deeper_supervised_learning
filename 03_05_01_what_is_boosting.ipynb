    "- __Boosting Models__ model the data over and over, each time adjusting the model based on what was learned from the previous one\n",
    "- Flexible: works for classification and regression, can be combined with many modeling approaches\n",
    "- Iterative: start with fitting a simple model on all the data, identify unexplained variance and build a new simple model to target that pool of information\n",
    "- Once stopping rule is reached, the combination of all models is used to make final predictions\n",
    "- Combines simple & computationally fast models to arrive at very accurate predictions"

    "- Stopping rule: set stopping threshold at number of models, amount of variance explained, or change in weights between last two iterations"
